Investigation Title	Gene expression of LNCaP human prostate cells by cholesterol diet							
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression of LNCaP human prostate cells by cholesterol diet
Experiment Description	Understanding the systemic regulation of normal prostate gene expression by cholesterol diet is critical for deciphering the mechanisms responsible for the transition from healthy to pathogenic prostate conditions. To understand mechanism under cholesterol effect on prostate, we performed microarray analysis using LNCaP human prostate cells cultured in low cholesterol medium. The RNA is obtained from LNCaP human prostate cells serum-starved for 0h, 3h, 16h followed by CLM medium.

Protocol Description	ID_REF = <br>VALUE = quantile normalized signal intensity	Microarray hybridization was performed by following general Affymetrix protocol at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute microarray core facility.	LNCaP human prostate tumor cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and kept cultured in RPMI1640 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin at 37Â°C under 5% CO2.	Data normalization and summarization of expression values for each probe were calculated using gcRMA method. Quantile normalization of the data was performed with gcrma R/Bioconductor package v2.11.	Scanning of microarrays were performed by following general Affymetrix protocol at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute microarray core facility.	LNCap human prostate tumor cells were serum-starved for 0h, 3h and 16h followed by CLM medium.	The RNAs were extracted using a Qiagen RNEasy tissue extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, California).	Biotinylated cRNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 6 ug total RNA (Expression Analysis Technical Manual, 2001, Affymetrix).
