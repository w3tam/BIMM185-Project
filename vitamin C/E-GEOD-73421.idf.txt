Investigation Title	Gene expression profiling of THP-1 cells on treatment with vitamin C						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Gene expression profiling of THP-1 cells on treatment with vitamin C
Experiment Description	The present study reports the temporal transcriptional response of THP-1 cells to physiological levels (100 Î¼M) of vit C treatment. An extensive modulation of gene expression occurs from early to late time-points, which is reflected in a gamut of functional responses regulated by vit C, as determined by enrichment analysis. The study reveals the pleiotropic activity of vit C with diverse implications on biological processes. vit C mediates responses that encompass a range of cellular processes, and span regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell cycle, immune system, cAMP metabolic process and signaling and ion homeostasis. Thus vit C modulates a plethora of physiological functions, that emphasize its key role in maintaining equilibrium.

Protocol Description	Images were quantified using Feature Extraction Software ( Agilent). Feature extracted raw data was analyzed using GeneSpring GX Version  software from Agilent. Normalization of the data was done in GeneSpring GX using the 75th percentile shift ID_REF =  VALUE = Log base 2 normalized signal	The samples were labeled using Agilent Quick Amp Kit (Part number: 5190-0442). 500ng of total RNA was reverse transcribed using oligodT primer tagged to T7 promoter sequence. cDNA thus obtained was converted to double stranded cDNA in the same reaction. Further the cDNA was converted to cRNA in the in-vitro transcription step using T7 RNA polymerase enzyme and Cy3 dye was added into the reaction mix. During cRNA synthesis Cy3 dye was incorporated into the newly synthesized strands. cRNA obtained was cleaned up using Qiagen RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Cat No: 74106).	600ng of labeled cRNA were hybridized on Custom Human Whole Genome 8x60K Array 8x60k designed by Genotypic Technology Private Limited (AMADID: 027114)using the Gene Expression Hybridization kit (Part Number 5190-0404; Agilent) in Sure hybridization Chambers (Agilent) at 65Âº C for 16 hours. Hybridized slides were washed using Agilent Gene Expression wash buffers (Part No: 5188-5327).	Nearly, 8 x 106 THP-1 cells were seeded in T-75 cm2 flasks in RMPI with 10% FBS. The cells were then differentiated with 30 nM PMA for 16-18 h. Following differentiation, the cells were allowed resting for 2-3 h. The cells were then treated with 0.1 mM vitamin C (vitC) and subsequently RNA was isolated from untreated control flasks and vit C treated flasks as 8 h, 24 h, 48 h and 96 h post vit C-addition.	THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 in 10% FBS. The cells were passaged at nearly 80% confluency. The experiment was performed at ~99% cell viability as determined by trypan blue exclusion method.	At respective time-point, the media was removed from the control and vit C-treated flasks. This was immediately followed by addition of TRI reagent and swirling the flasks in order to lyse the adhered cells. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4C. The supernatant was used for RNA extraction using bromochloropropane method.Briefly, 1/10th volume of bromochloropropane (Molecular Research Center, USA) was added to the samples and vigorously shaken for 10 sec. The samples were then incubated for 10 min at room temperature (for phase separation). The aqueous phase was separated by centrifuging the samples at 12000 rpm for 15 min at 4Â°C. The RNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated with 1/100th volume of polyacryl carrier and isopropanol (0.6 volumes, for 30 min), centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 4Â°C for 15 min) and washed with 75% ethanol and then air-dried. Total RNA was dissolved in 100 Î¼l of DEPC-treated water.	Scanned using the Agilent Microarray G2505C scanner (Agilent Technologies)
