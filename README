This script is intended to provide scores for different foods and food 
chemicals associated with 53 different cancer cell lines. The scores
are intended to be used to predict which foods and chemicals are most
effective at treating different cancers. A positive score represents a positive
prediction in which the food or chemical is expected to the treatment of the
associated cancer while a negative score means that the food or chemical is
expected to contribute to the progression of cancer.
